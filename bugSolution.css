The correct usage of `calc()` ensures accurate calculations.  Always include spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the parentheses. For example:

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
height: calc(50vh + 20px);
```

Failure to include these spaces may lead to unexpected rendering results or parsing errors.
