The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results can occur due to missing spaces around operators. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px);` will not work as expected, because there is no space between `100%` and `-`.  The correct syntax is `width:calc(100% - 10px);`.
